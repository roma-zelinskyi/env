# env
Ununtu dev enviroment.

## Description
This is my preferred dev configuration that is suitable for C/C++ projects. The purpose of this project is to be able to set up new environment in one command. For that project containes top level setup.sh script that installs and configure NeoVim and clnag-format.

## Installation
```setup.sh``` will install and configure: 
* NeoVim with plugins 
* clang-format
* Copy .gitconfig and .bashrc to home dir

It is as well possible to install each submodule separately, by executing ```setup.sh``` in desired subdirectory
